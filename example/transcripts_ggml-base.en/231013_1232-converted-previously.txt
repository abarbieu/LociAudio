[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   What I'm trying to say is that the appeal is certain for so far.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Well you mean that communication management until like storm would be brought into the
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.920]   appeal process?
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.720]   Right, we see connection to the appeal.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.400]   I hope you understand there are issues of reputation and I have to deal with those in
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.560]   the appeal process rather than the commercial issues around settlement.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.920]   And then this is the appeal to defamation.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.560]   I believe that the application we can proceed with for defamation.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.320]   Yeah, I'll investigate it to what we have as written evidence of what we do not have.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.920]   Okay, great. I'm thankful for you to do that.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.080]   Absolutely.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.480]   Evidence is important, you know,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.760]   and if you understand what a party question has after a program,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.280]   it's a process.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.680]   And there is a great possibility of definition to everybody's services like this.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.120]   Exactly.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000]   I hope you feel that I've been listening to.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.920]   Yeah, absolutely. Thank you.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.720]   What I've also noted down from this is that there are a number of other people
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.240]   that I need to speak to, which I'll do as quickly as I possibly can.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.600]   It vaulted a race to this conversation number of points which I now need to go about and
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.840]   test with the other perspective to try and make them a judgement about working off the
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840]   evidence side.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.000]   It means strictly because it's a lot of confrontation with personal stuff and in fact
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.640]   my team is also sort of there on my mind.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.840]   So I had to very start this whole process.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.840]   I thought it was good.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.840]   You know it's reasonably good.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.440]   We dealt with very, very quickly and very, very smoothly.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.040]   Or it could just be a traumatic long drawn up process.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.400]   I would appreciate that, the fact that you have of course your personal interest and the
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.200]   conventional that you have an intention to make this work if at all possible and the
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.760]   way it makes sense to the other party too.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   So appreciate that.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.760]   The truth is I went for a tune of periods that wasn't, you know, if that wasn't a game
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   you're interested in talking about the standard.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.240]   Ok Justin, thank you for struggling and so far.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.240]   What else would you want to cover?
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   The thing really, the bits in the rest, not the rest of the day, to talk about the timeline,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   Maybe it's going to be quicker than the original door.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.240]   I won't worry about any back thing, but I'll never live for the world half the time.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   I think I'd go back to everyone, but I mean,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   but to understand the evidence we spoke about and how the trade we got to serious.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   Written evidence would be important.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.240]   However, I'll be challenging them with many of the points we've made in this conversation.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   Alright, that's not school.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   Okay, thank you very much. We have a good day.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   Yeah, thank you.
